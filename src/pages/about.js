          Los Angeles is the world capital of media and entertainment, yet most
          LA County schools do not prepare students to take on jobs in these
          industries. ArtsMatter addresses these gaps by creating and sharing
          educational programming based in media arts to increase exposure and
          access to career pathways and equip students of color with the skills
          they need for success in the local creative economy.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="rich-text">
          ArtsMatter creates standards-based curriculum and instructional
          materials to be paired with hands-on Professional Development training
          for teachers to increase student engagement in schools while building
          teachersâ€™ capacity to integrate arts learning in their classrooms.
          Trained teachers then become ambassadors in their larger school
          communities to activate county-wide impact projects to advance media
          arts education not only in Los Angeles, but in every city across the
          country.{" "}
